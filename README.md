# ðŸ“Š XGBoost-Based Academic & Health Data Predictor

This repository contains an XGBoost model trained to analyze **academic performance** and **health data** for early prediction of mental health risks. It is developed as part of the **AI Powered Smart Cognitive Tracker** â€” a multimodal AI system designed to identify cognitive and emotional decline in adolescents.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Context

Changes in grades, attendance, or health symptoms often reflect early mental distress. This model uses structured tabular data (e.g., marks, BMI, absenteeism) to detect patterns that correlate with emotional or cognitive decline.
